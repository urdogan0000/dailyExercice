# Daily Algorithm Practice (30 Days)

A structured 30-day coding practice repository focused entirely on algorithm problems in TypeScript. Each day contains one interview-style problem. Backend exercises have been removed per your request.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables (copy from examples):
```bash
cp day1/backend/env.example day1/backend/.env
# Repeat for other days as needed
```

### Running the Exercises
```bash
# Run a specific day's algorithm problem
npx ts-node day1/algorithm/problem.ts
npx ts-node day2/algorithm/problem.ts
npx ts-node day10/algorithm/problem.ts
npx ts-node day20/algorithm/problem.ts
npx ts-node day30/algorithm/problem.ts

### Daily Non-Coding Interview Questions
Each day also includes an `interview.md` with a mid-level technical non-coding interview question (e.g., debugging prod issues, API versioning, incident response, trade-off decisions). Review and answer it along with coding the algorithm.
```

#### Backend Exercises
```bash
# Run a specific day's backend server
npx ts-node day1/backend/server.ts
npx ts-node day2/backend/server.ts
# ... and so on
```

#### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Days 21-30
- Kth Largest Element, Top K Frequent Elements, Course Schedule, Number of Islands, Implement Trie, LCA in BST, Serialize/Deserialize Binary Tree, Word Ladder, Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm start` - Run the compiled JavaScript
- `npm run dev` - Run with ts-node for development
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

## 📝 How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Day 1**: Begin with the first day's exercises
2. **Read the Problem**: Each algorithm problem includes detailed description and examples
3. **Implement Your Solution**: Write your code in the provided function
4. **Test Your Solution**: Run the test cases to verify correctness
5. **Move to Backend**: Complete the corresponding backend exercise
6. **Repeat Daily**: Move to the next day's exercises

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### Algorithm Skills
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- Algorithm patterns (two pointers, sliding window, dynamic programming)
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Problem-solving strategies

### Backend Skills
- Express.js fundamentals
- Middleware development
- Authentication and authorization
- API design and development
- Error handling and validation
- Testing strategies

## 🔧 Configuration

### TypeScript
The project uses strict TypeScript configuration with:
- ES2020 target
- Strict type checking
- Path mapping for clean imports
- Source maps for debugging

### Testing
Jest configuration includes:
- TypeScript support
- Coverage reporting
- Path mapping for imports
- Node.js environment

## 📖 Tips for Success

1. **Consistency**: Try to complete one day's exercises daily
2. **Understanding**: Don't just solve, understand the approach
3. **Optimization**: After solving, think about time/space complexity
4. **Practice**: Implement multiple solutions for the same problem
5. **Documentation**: Add comments explaining your approach
