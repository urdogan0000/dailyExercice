Mid-level technical non-coding question

You're reviewing a PR that adds a complex feature with limited tests. How do you provide feedback that improves quality while keeping delivery on track?

---

First, I confirm that the feature works as intended and doesn’t break existing functionality — ensuring the team can keep delivery on track.

Next, I review the code for clarity, maintainability, and alignment with our project’s standards — checking things like naming conventions, SOLID principles, and overall readability.

If the implementation is complex but lightly tested, I suggest adding focused unit or integration tests for critical paths, without blocking the PR entirely. For example, I might propose adding at least one test per major logic branch before merging, and plan a follow-up task for broader coverage.

I also check for any performance or scalability concerns — such as suboptimal algorithms or data structures — and recommend improvements only if they’re impactful for this release.

The goal is to balance code quality and delivery speed, improving what matters most right now while noting other enhancements for later.
